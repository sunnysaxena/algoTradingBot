When naming a feature branch in your "algoTrading" project, follow a structured format to keep things organized and meaningful. A good naming convention includes:

### 📌 Recommended Format:

    feature/{short-description}

or

    feature/{task-id}-{short-description}


### 🔹 Example Branch Names


Feature	Branch Name

| Feature                   | Branch Name                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Add support for Fyers API	 | feature/fyers-integration     |
|Implement EMA & RSI strategy	 | feature/ema-rsi-strategy      |
|Add WebSocket for live data	| feature/websocket-streaming   |
|Improve order execution logic	 | feature/order-execution       |
|Store encrypted credentials	| feature/encrypted-credentials |
|Add broker selection UI	   | feature/broker-selection-ui   |
|Automate options trading	  | feature/options-trading-bot   |


### 🔹 If Using Jira, Trello, or Issue Trackers
If you have task IDs from Jira, Trello, etc., include them:

    feature/JIRA-123-live-data-streaming

    feature/TASK-456-trade-execution


### 🔹 Branch Naming Tips

✅ Keep it short & descriptive

✅ Use kebab-case (hyphens instead of spaces)

✅ Avoid generic names like feature/update

✅ Stick to a standard format for consistency


#### ❌ Not Recommended: feature/miscellaneous is too vague.
<br>

### ✅ Better Alternative:   

If the feature covers **multiple unrelated changes**, try to break them into **separate feature branches** with specific names.

If it's truly a **mixed bag of minor updates**, consider:

* `feature/misc-fixes` (if small fixes)
* `feature/refactor-cleanup` (if code improvements)
* `feature/general-improvements` (if multiple enhancements)

🔹 **Best Practice:** A feature branch should focus on a **single** change or improvement for better tracking and collaboration. 🚀
