# Best Time-Series Databases for Algo Trading

For algorithmic trading, you need a time-series database that is:

* **Fast for inserts and queries** (low-latency)
* **Efficient in storage** (handles large volumes of tick data)
* **Supports real-time streaming** (WebSockets & event-driven architectures)
* **Scalable for backtesting and live trading**


## Best Time-Series Databases for Algo Trading

### 1. TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL Extension)
✅ **Best for**: Structured time-series data (OHLCV, order book data)

✅ **Key Features**:
* PostgreSQL-based (familiar SQL queries)
* Compression for efficient storage
* Continuous aggregation (fast queries on large datasets)
* Supports **JOINs, indexing, partitioning**

❌ **Downside**: Slower than NoSQL for high-frequency tick data

### 2. InfluxDB

✅ **Best for**: High-frequency tick data, real-time monitoring

✅ **Key Features**:
* Optimized for time-series (faster inserts than SQL)
* **Retention policies** (auto-delete old data)
* **Flux query language** (more flexible than SQL)
* Supports WebSockets for real-time streaming

❌ **Downside**: No SQL support (not ideal for complex queries)

### 3. ClickHouse
✅ Best for: Fast analytical queries on large datasets

✅ Key Features:
* Columnar storage (fast reads/writes)
* High compression (efficient for tick data)
* Good for backtesting large datasets

❌ **Downside**: Not optimized for real-time streaming

### 4. QuestDB

✅ **Best for**: Low-latency querying and real-time streaming

✅ **Key Features**:
* Fastest SQL-based time-series DB (compares with ClickHouse)
* Supports SQL + time-series functions
* Supports WebSockets + InfluxDB Line Protocol

❌ **Downside**: Less mature than TimescaleDB

### 5. kdb+ (Q Language)

✅ **Best for: HFT & institutional trading firms**

✅ **Key Features:**

* Lightning-fast tick data processing
* Used by banks & hedge funds
* 
❌ **Downside**: Expensive & complex (requires Q language)


## Best Choice for Your Setup
Since you're handling tick data, OHLCV, WebSockets, and algo execution, the best combo would be:

1. **TimescaleDB** → Store structured OHLCV data (SQL-based).
2. **InfluxDB** → Handle real-time tick data with WebSockets.
3. **ClickHouse** → Store and analyze large historical datasets.
